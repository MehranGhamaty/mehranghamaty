### Yo!

I'm currently a Software Engineer, working to build real time analytical applications with machine learning techniques.
I hold a the following degrees; Masters of Science, Computer Engineer and a Bachelor of Science, Computer Engineer.
I also have an incomplete PhD in Computer Science & Engineering.

In my free time I like to work on my pet project tool kit for [Point Processes](https://github.com/MehranGhamaty/point_processes).
Which was an attempt at unifying some expressions with existing tools. My grammer is also horrendous.
