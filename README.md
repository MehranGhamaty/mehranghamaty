### Yo!

I'm currently a Software Engineer, working to build real time analytical applications with machine learning techniques.
I hold a Masters of Science in Computer Engineering and a Bachelor of Science in the same field and an incomplete Doctoral degree.


In my free time I like to work on my pet project tool kit for [Point Processes](https://github.com/MehranGhamaty/point_processes).
Which was an attempt at unifying some expressions with existing tools. For now I just stick with existing tools that other people built.
If anybody wants to help finish the kit feel free to shoot me an email from the contact given in the profile. I have lots of papers and surveys.
